// Problem 02. Modify Average
// Write a program that modifies a number until the average value of all of its digits is higher than 5. In order to modify the number, your program should append a 9 to the end of the number, when the average value of all of its digits is higher than 5 the program should stop appending. If the number’s average value of all of its digits is already higher than 5, no appending should be done.
// The input is a single number received as a string. The output should consist of a single number - the final modified number which has an average value of all of its digits higher than 5. The output should be printed on the console.
// Constraints:  The input number will consist of no more than 6 digits.
//  The input will be a valid number (there will be no leading zeroes).
// Examples
// Input Output
// 101 1019999
// 5835 5835
